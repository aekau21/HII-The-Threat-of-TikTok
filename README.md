# The Threat of TikTok and State Sponsored Media

During my HII Summer internship capstone, I conducted a sentiment analysis on TikTok user reviews using natural language processing techniques and the supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.

In the analysis, I found that many current users of TikTok express positive sentiments about the app, despite many Americans considering it a threat to national security based on research released by the Pew Research Center.
